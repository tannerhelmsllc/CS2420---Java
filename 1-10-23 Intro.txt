1 linked list in this project
	- FIFO Queue

The game will just be stored as an array of <E>
First Programming assignemnt - Puzzle - JAVA
	- have board with 8 tile with 1 blank
	- goal is to get them in order, moving 1 at a time
	- Use a GENERIC(can use any data type) linked list. THIS IS FOR THE 
		- Functions:
			- Add
				- Always add to the tail
			- Delete, takes in no parameters but returns the deleted item to check for future moves
				- Always delete from the head
			- printContents

	public class LinkedList {
		int Head
		Generic<t> Data
		int tail
	}
	-Step two calculate all the possible ways to solve)

	-Step two Solve the board (minimal number of choices
		- Store the guesses in a FIFO queue
		- After a move, dont add the opposite move to the queue

public class Board

	Generic State
	string Steps
}

[State 275483601 steps: ]
[State 275403681 steps: D, State 275483610 steps: L, State 275483061 steps: R]
[State 275483610 steps: L, State 275483061 steps: R, State 205473681 steps: DD, State 275430681 steps: DL, State 275043681 steps: DR]

We are taking off the first thing. looking for possible more moves, then adding it to the list.
