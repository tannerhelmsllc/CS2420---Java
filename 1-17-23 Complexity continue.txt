knapsack problem
	- Greedy appraoch
		- try to do what is optimal. 
		- But it doesnt always give you the best solution
Complexity Classes (best to worst)
	- O(1) constant
		- picking first from list
	- O(log n) logarithmic
		- binary search
	- O(n) linear, geometric progression(how to solve:look this up)
		- find in unordered list
	- O(n log n)
		- quicksort
	- O(n^2) quadratic
		- all fist bump with everyone in a group
	- O(n^3) cubic
		- matrix multiply
	- O(2^2) exponential
		- knapsack Intractable
	- O(n!) factorial
		- find all paths
